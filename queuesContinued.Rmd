#Prerequisites

This vignette continues from concepts covered in the vignette: "Introduction to Queueing Theory and Queueing Models".

#

#Simulating a M/M/1 queue

Simulate an example of a simple M/M/1 queueing process

#Introduction to performance measures for queues

Perform an analysis of the simulated M/M/1 queueing process including a steady state analysis of the system (stationary distribution) and performance measures (loss probability, average waiting time, idle time).
